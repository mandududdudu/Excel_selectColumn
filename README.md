# Excel_selectColumn
This is the VBA coding that is very easy to indicate which column is the nth columns number that you inputted.

Please refer to the flowchart to understand more on the flow. 

Used case #1 : 
I want to check 29th columns will be which columns ? AA is 26th columns, and I am too lazy to actually calculate.
1. open the excel and run this VBA code. 
2. input 59 in the pop up box.
3. the output will select the 29th columns which is column AD. 


Used case #2 : 
I want to go to column FE but i am lazy to keep scrolling to the left until column FE
1. open the excel and run this VBA code.
2. input FE in the pop up box.
3. the output will select the column FE. 

Hopefully this can help you. 
Following idea : 
I can input number or character, and the result should display the column name, not the number.
